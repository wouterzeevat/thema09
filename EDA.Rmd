```{r}
data <- read.csv('Autism_Data.arff')
data
```
This is the data that will be used in the following project. it contains various information about adults doing an autism test. The columns speak for themselves except for the first 10. These columns represent the anwsers of the following question list.

https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg142/resources/autism-spectrum-quotient-aq10-test-pdf-186582493

This is a general question list and the questions do not really matter. Each question gives points for the selected anwser. The more points the people have, the more chance there is of them having ADS (Autism disorder spectrum).

The last column is also a little unclear. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
