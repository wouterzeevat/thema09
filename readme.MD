# Wouter Zeevat BFV3
This project is made in order to complete theme 9. The project contains 2 main directories. Software and Reports. Both contain a more detailled readme in order to describe their parts!

#### https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faizunnabi/autism-screening
This is the dataset that will be used in the project.

## Reports
This folder contains all the reports. These are an important part of the project such as the EDA, The Report and files that were used in order to create the weka model.

## Software
This folder contains the java wrapper that uses the model and classifies instances. In order to run it you need to run Software\ASD_Model\build\libs\ASD_Model-1.0.0.jar! A more accurate instruction to do this is in the readme located in the software folder.
